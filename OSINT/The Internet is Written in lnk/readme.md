# Solution

`CTF Clock` is probably referring to `CTF Time`

I’m not sure what the number four hundred refers to, but I am thinking probably 404 error?

I found a [The Wayback Machine](https://archive.org/web/) that can go back to the past site

I copied the path of Down Under CTF on CTFtime (`https://ctftime.org/event/1312`) and pasted it in The Wayback Machine
