# Solution

I searched a lot of station images with keyword `australia` and there are many stations in `melbourne` but there is not any image that looks like what i am looking for

Then I searched the image with the keyword ` abandoned train station melbourne` to find the flag. you can see this station looks like it's abandoned with graffiti on the wall and no trains so that's why i thought of that keyword 19

> So we got the flag: `DUCTF{general_motors_railway_station}`
