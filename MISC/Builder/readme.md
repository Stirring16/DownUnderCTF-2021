# Solution 

Challenge provide an mdf file Hmmm! We can read them with notepad

I used [FILEtxt](https://filext.com/) to check which software can open them

So you can see: 

> It's a text file, that's all we have found out. The file has a few characteristics of a `LDR (LDraw Model)` file. 

```
File created by LDraw, a CAD toolkit used for building digital LEGO 3D models; contains the dimensions of the LEGO bricks and their position in the 3D coordinate system; used to save LEGO designs.

```
Install it:

Now you can open builder.mdp with LDview

Which looks almost like a flag. There's the DUCTF logo, and a couple of letters and numbers surrounded by braces, but it's clearly incomplete. Looking around the model, you see something interesting hidden underneath the baseplates.

So, everywhere you see one of the red 1x2 plates, you need to add that big curved brick. And you can see that the first one - the one that makes up the letter C - has been done for you.
You can use Paint.net to add it

> So we got the flag: DUCTF{CaD4L3G0!}
